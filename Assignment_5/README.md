**Assignment Title:** Linear Regression Model

---

### **Steps Taken**

1. Loaded the prepared **Telecom Customer Churn** dataset in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets using `train_test_split`.
3. Implemented **Linear Regression** from `sklearn.linear_model`.
4. Trained the model on the training data and made predictions on the test set.
5. Evaluated performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

### **Output**

| Metric                             | Value   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**      | 13.2929 |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | 16.9285 |

---

### **Challenges Faced**

* Some features required scaling and encoding before fitting the model.
* Understanding the difference between MAE and RMSE when evaluating performance.
* Needed to ensure data was clean and numeric for regression compatibility.
