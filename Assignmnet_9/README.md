## Week 9 – Neural Networks Basics

## Assignment: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Customer Churn Prediction

---

## Brief Description

In Week 9, the focus was on understanding the **fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** and applying them to a real-world dataset.
An ANN model was developed to predict **Telecom Customer Churn**, allowing comparison between traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches.

This week helped bridge the gap between **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, emphasizing how neural networks learn complex patterns from data.

## Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow

## Steps Taken

1. Loaded the cleaned Telecom Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle into Jupyter Notebook.
2. Performed final preprocessing:

   * Handled missing values
   * Encoded categorical features
   * Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
3. Selected **Customer Status / Churn** as the target variable.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% / 20%).
5. Built a **Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using Keras:

   * Input Layer
   * One or more Hidden Layers (ReLU activation)
   * Output Layer (Sigmoid / Softmax depending on classes)
6. Compiled the model using:

   * Optimizer: Adam
   * Loss function: Binary / Categorical Crossentropy
   * Metric: Accuracy
7. Trained the ANN model and monitored loss and accuracy.
8. Evaluated the ANN model on test data.
9. Compared ANN performance with earlier Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest).
